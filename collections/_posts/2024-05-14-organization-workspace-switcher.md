### Key Features
  - **Resource Sharing**: Spaces allow for seamless resource sharing among team members, fostering collaboration.
  - **Logical Grouping**: Within Spaces, you can group related components such as environments and infrastructure designs.
  - **Flexibility**: Spaces support various resources like Kubernetes, Prometheus, Jaeger, Nginx, and more.
  - **Simplified Management**: Managing and deploying resources is made easy within Spaces.
  - **Access Control**: Spaces allow you to control access to resources by granting permissions to users and teams.

We are now exposing the ability to switch between different organization and different workspace,this will enable users to :

- Different spaces have different level of restriction 
- Switch to an organization where they have the required permissions.
